2.  The history of this database is summarized here. CAA's data base
of information on historical land combat battles and engagements
exists in two distinct forms. One is the traditional printed report
form, and the other is in the form of computerized data files. Both
versions contain historical information on over 600 land combat
battles that took place between 1600AD and 1990AD. The report version
has gone through several iterations, as described below.

	a.	The first version of the data base is documented in CAA Study
Report CAA-SR-84-6, "Analysis of Factors That Have Influenced Outcomes
of Battles and Wars: A Data Base of Battles and Engagements,"
September 1984, in six volumes. It was prepared for CAA under contract
number MDA903-82-C-0363, and is available from DTIC under the
following accession numbers: AD-B086-797L, AD-B087-718L, AD-B087-719L,
AD-B087-720L, AD-B087-721L, and AD-B087-722L.

	b.	The second version is documented as "changes to" the first
version in HERO Report Number 129, "Combat History Analysis Study
Effort (CHASE) Data Enhancement Study (CDES)," 31 January 1986, in
five volumes. It was prepared for CAA under Contract Number
MDA903-85-C-0252 and is available from DTIC under the following
accession numbers: AD-A175-712, AD-A175-713, AD-A175-714, AD-A175-715,
and AD-A175-716. The objective of the CDES work was to correct
omissions, inconsistencies, and ambiguities in the battle and
engagement data base being used in the CHASE Study. The scope of the
CDES work included:

	(1) Analyze about 400 data base problem reports generated while
encoding the original HERO data into machine-readable format.
	(2) State for each battle whether its total engaged personnel
strength is the initial, average, or total strength.
	(3) State for each battle whether HERO determined its victorious
side on the basis of a clear-cut decisive resolution, or on the basis
of mission accomplishment.
	(4) Give for each battle duration data in hours and minutes rather
than in "days".
	(5) State for each battle the defender's width of front.
	(6) State for each battle with a dual posture descriptor whether
it represents an "average" or a "combination" posture.
	(7) Provide for each battle estimates of the relative reliability
of its personnel strength and casualty data.
	(8) Develop strength and attrition histories for selected battles.
	(9) Comment on CAA's attempt to eliminate unwanted redundancies in
the data.

	The principal findings of CDES are that, despite the care taken in
the DATABASE contract to prepare the original data base, and despite
the further effort in the CDES contract to rid it of errors, a number
still remain. Lessons learned included the practical impossibility of
assuring the high reliability of historical data bases.

	c.	The third version is documented as "changes to" the first and
second versions in unnumbered HERO Report "Data Base Error Correction
(DBEC)," 23 January 1987. It was prepared for CAA under Purchase Order
Number MDA903-86-M-8560 and is available from DTIC under accession
number AD-A176-750. The DBEC effort was motivated by a desire to purge
the data base of as many errors as humanly possible. Its scope
included:

	(1) Correct advance rate data.
	(2) Resolve discrepancies in the duration data.
	(3) Correct a variety of errors.
    (4) Provide definitions for two data types that were previously
undefined.
	(5) Provide a list of errata for the CDES report.

	The principal finding of the DBEC effort was that discrepancies
remain between some of the narrative descriptions of battle and the
data base--no attempt was made to correct them within the scope of the
DBEC effort. The major topic for future research is that not all of
the errors in the data base have as yet been identified and corrected.
The lessons learned underscored the difficulty of assuring high
reliability in historical combat data bases.

	d.	In addition to the above, an independent review and
reassessment of the data for about 60 selected battles whose data are
considered to be statistically anomalous is documented in the
unnumbered LFW Management Associates, Inc. Report "Independent
Review/Reassessment of Anomalous Data (IR/RAD)," 22 June 1987, in four
volumes. It was prepared for CAA under Contract Number
MDA903-86-C-0396. It is available from DTIC under the following
accession numbers: AD-???-??? (Volume I), AD-195-726 (Volume II),
AD-???-??? (Volume III), and AD-???-??? (Volume IV). The objective of
the IR/RAD work was to perform an independent review/reassessment of
certain historical battle data. It was motivated by the CHASE Interim
Progress Report's finding that the data for these particular battles
are statistically anomalous. The scope of the IR/RAD effort included
developing new and original historical data for 61 anomalous battles
in 8 campaigns of World War II and the Arab-Israeli wars. The implied
EEA was to provide a factual basis for determining whether the
anomalies are attributable to actual changes in combat dynamics, or
whether they are more likely due to flaws in the data base.

	The principal finding was that, in virtually every case, the
IR/RAD contractor's data differ substantially from those determined by
the authors of the original data base. Major topics for future
research include determining the validity, exact nature and extent,
theoretical implications, and practical significance of these
differences between the two groups of historical analysts. The most
important lesson learned appears to be that it is very difficult to
assure high quality in historical combat data bases.

	e.	Use was also made of Data Memory Systems Incorporated report,
"New Engagement Data for the Breakpoints Data Base," prepared for the
US Army Concepts Analysis Agency under Contract No. MDA903-87-C-0807,
30 September 1988. This, report, in conjunction with independent
research by Mr. Robert McQuie of CAA, provided data on about 59
additional battles, and these have been added to the current version
of CAA's land combat data base, Version 1990 (CDB90).

3.	The work described above has resulted in a comprehensive data base
of land combat battles from 1600AD to the present, describing
quantitatively many of their features. Despite its shortcomings, it is
the largest and most comprehensive free world database of quantitative
information on battles. It is particularly well suited to statistical
analyses of the type described below (para 4). Its preparation was
motivated by the understanding that historical battle data are
essential for important advances in the quality of Army modeling,
together with a recognition that the previously-available combat data
were either insufficiently detailed or not systematically organized
into the quantitative data base form required for validating
contemporary battalion to army-level models. The scope of the data
base includes a tabulation of about 80 items of information and a
synopsis of the action for each battle. Specific EEAs were not stated,
but implicit ones include:

	a.	What data are available?

	b.	How can it best be presented?

	The principal finding is that it is feasible to construct an
extensive and well-organized data base of quantitative information on
battles. Important issues and topics for future research include
devising improved criteria for deciding what data to put in the data
base, developing improved approaches to analyzing this sort of data,
and inventing ingenious ways of applying the results to important Army
issues. The most important lessons learned are that:

	a.	The successful development of a high-quality combat data base
requires a multidisciplinary approach in which military archivists and
historians work together with military operations analysts,
statisticians, epistemologists, and scientists with a strong "hard
science" background.

	b.	Developing a data base adequate for use in model development
and model validation is an extremely difficult task. It requires a
very substantial investment in time, resources, and talent.

	c.	Devising good ways to analyze and apply the data are at least
as important as the data themselves. These often require more advanced
technical training than compilation of the data itself.

4.	The labor of reducing the database to digitized form was done by
the undersigned in-house at CAA, mainly under the Combat History
Analysis Study Effort (CHASE), Aug 84-Aug 85 [see US Army Concepts
Analysis Agency Technical Paper CAA-TP-86-2, "Combat History Analysis
Study Effort (CHASE): Progress Report for the Period August 1984June
1985," August 1986]. The objective of the CHASE Progress Report was to
describe the work done on CHASE from August 1984 to June 1985. It was
motivated by a desire to analyze the CAA Database of Battles (CDB), in
order to provide its information to military operations analysts in a
form suitable for their use. Its scope included:

	a.	Reducing to machine-readable form all of the data tabulated in
the data base.

	b.	Assessing the suitability of the data base for quantitative
analysis.

	c.	Summarizing selected portions of these data to facilitate
their efficient use in military operations research, concept
formulation, wargaming, and studies and analyses.

	d.	Seeking important trends and interrelations present but hidden
in these data.

	e.	Testing selected hypotheses against the data.

The EEAs for CHASE were:

	a.	Can the factors that have historically been most closely
identified with victory in battle be identified?

	b.	What long-term trends can be detected in historical combat
data?

	c.	Can the historical influence of air support on the outcome of
land battles be quantified?

	d.	What can be said about the factors influencing rates of
advance in land combat?

	e.	What lessons were learned regarding the preparation of battle
and engagement data bases for use in quantitative analyses?

The principal findings of the CHASE Interim Progress Report were:

	a.	Data on historical battles can be used to discover
quantitative trends and relations of great potential significance to
military operations research, concept formulation, wargaming, and
studies and analyses.

	b.	Victory in battle is largely dependent on the defender's
"advantage parameter," a quantity dependent only on the initial
personnel strengths and losses.

	c.	Traditional "breakpoint hypotheses" which state that forces
disengage based solely on their own casualty experience do not agree
with the historical data.

The major topics identified in the CHASE Interim Progress Report as
issues for future research include:

	a.	There is a need for detailed quantitative data on strengths at
intermediate stages during the course of a battle.

    b.  Even the large CDB database of battles is not large enough to
support adequately all of the statistical analyses that should be
performed.

	c.	Typographical mistakes, omissions, ambiguities and ill-defined
data categories in the data base weakened some of the analysis results
and precluded some others. Data inadequacies and the limited scope of
this initial phase of the CHASE study prevented all of the EEAs from
being fully addressed.

	Throughout the CHASE study, the most important lesson learned is
that successful analysis of this sort of data requires simultaneously
a firm grasp of statistical principles, a familiarity with
epistemological considerations, a solid grounding in the "hard"
sciences, a broad knowledge of military history, a good appreciation
for what is feasible in military operations, and a practical sense of
what information is most useful to a military operations analyst.
These qualities are rarely found combined in an individual who is also
blessed with the time, talent, experience, inclination, data bases,
computational resources, and the organizational and financial support
essential to successful prosecution of this kind of work.
